                Take steps to protect yourself and others.
                - Practice physical distancing. This is not the same as self-isolation. You do not need to remain indoors, but you do need to avoid being in close contact with people.
                - Practice good hygiene: wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes, and avoid touching your face.
                - Monitor for COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or runny nose.
                - If you do develop any COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and take this self-assessment again.
